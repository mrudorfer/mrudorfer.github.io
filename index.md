## hi!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/computer-science/artificial-intelligence/intelligent-robotics-lab/index.aspx) at [Unviersity of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/).
My research area includes robotics and computer vision.
Currently, I am working on a research project for benchmarking and understanding robotic grasping.
