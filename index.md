## hi!

I am a Lecturer in Computer Science at [Aston University](https://aston.ac.uk), Birmingham.
My research areas include robotic grasping and manipulation, reproducibility in robotics research, and ethical considerations in robotics & AI.
I am also part of the [Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory](https://cs.aston.ac.uk/arp).

I got invited to a discussion about teaching in higher education at my former university [TU Berlin](https://www.zewk.tu-berlin.de/v_menue/wissenschaftliche_weiterbildung/lehren_und_lernen/lunch_fuer_gute_lehre/). Back then I participated in many great workshops and was able to get the qualified teaching certificate. It was great to meet former friends and colleagues and be part of the discussion!

I am starting a new position as Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at Aston University!
I am delighted to join the team here at Aston and look forward to fruitful collaborations with my new colleagues. Moreover, I am happy to get back to teaching and supervising students again. A new part of my work will now also be writing project proposals, acquiring research funding, and at some point supervising my first PhD students!
