## research

My first research was in computer vision: I started with traffic sign recognition during my diploma thesis and from there moved to more general object detection and 6d pose estimation.
In my PhD I focused on service-based architectures for applying these computer vision methods in a manufacturing context.
My research then gradually extended to the robotics domain, first in the context of assembly tasks with known objects and now my focus are data-driven methods for robotic grasping of novel objects.
One aspect of that is the benchmarking of grasping and manipulation methods to foster comparability and reproducibility of experimental results.

### object detection and 6d pose estimation

- point pair feature matching
- render and compose synthetic images to generate training data for Deep-Learning-based methods
